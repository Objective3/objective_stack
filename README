ObjectiveStack
A Rails template from Objective 3
Author: Blake Watters <blake@objective3.com>

This package provides a set of Rails plugins, gems, and other bits codifying the
Objective 3 way of building Rails applications. The stack focuses on BDD, rapid 
prototyping, high code coverage, elegant markup, and a solid foundation for 
monitoring and instrumenting the application.

Recommended Extras:

Search:
We strongly recommend the use of Sphinx as a searching solution for your Rails
apps. We further strongly recommend the excellent Thinking Sphinx plugin from
Pat Allen to provide the Rails infrastructure for your search needs. It is an
excellent plugin and outshines the other solutions we have evaluated.
